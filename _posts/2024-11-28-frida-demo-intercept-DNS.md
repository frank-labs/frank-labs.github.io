title:  "Frida Demo: Intercept DNS Resolution "
---

On the class Intro to Hacking, we made a introduction to Frida, and demostrated on Windows and Android of how we can use it. Here I will record the process of the Frida demo on Windows.

## What is Frida

On its website, it say itâ€™s a "dynamic code instrumentation toolkit" which let you "inject snippets of JavaScript into native apps on Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, etc. " while this may sound general, they also some use-cases why someone want to use it.

I haven't used it before, but love to have a tool at hand. So I dececed to explore how it works on Windows.
